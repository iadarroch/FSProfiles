# Microsoft Flight Simulator Controller Bindings Utility

This utility was born out of frustration that Asobo have given users no way to see what
controller bindings have been set up.

You can use it to select multiple controller profiles (e.g. Mouse, Flight Stick, 
Flight Throttle and Rudder Pedals), and display an HTML formatted document showing
each available control binding, and the controller & input bound to it.

Options for use:
* Select a single profile to see all its bindings
* Select two different profiles for a controller to compare bindings
* Select your active controller profiles to get a list of all current bindings.
